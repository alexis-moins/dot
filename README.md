`dot` is a bash script allowing users to manage their dotfiles using a centralized cli.

## Prerequisites

- bash 4.0 or higher
- [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)
- stow
- git


## ðŸ§° Installation

### Using dot

Clone the repository in the recommended location
```bash
git clone git@github.com:alexis-moins/dot.git ~/.dot
```

Go into the install directory and let dot take care of the rest!
```bash
DOT_INSTALL_DIR=$(pwd) ./dot link
```

The last command creates a symbolic link to the `dot` script in the `~/.local/bin/` directory (you can also change the link destination path). 

> If you did not clone the repository in `~/.dot`, don't forget to set the `DOT_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable globally afterwards!

### Manually

Clone the repository then move the [dot](dot) script to anywhere in your `PATH`, and ensure it is executable!
