`dot` is a bash script allowing users to manage their dotfiles using a centralized cli.

## Prerequisites

- bash 4.0 or higher
- [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)
- stow
- git


## ðŸ§° Installation

### Using dot

Clone the repository in the recommended location
```bash
git clone git@github.com:alexis-moins/dot.git ~/.dot
```

Go into the install directory and let dot take care of the rest!
```bash
DOT_INSTALL_DIR=$(pwd) ./dot link
```

The last command creates a symbolic link to the `dot` script in the `~/.local/bin/` directory (you can also change the link destination path). 

> If you did not clone the repository in `~/.dot`, don't forget to set the `DOT_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable globally afterwards!

### Manually

Clone the repository then move the [dot](dot) script to anywhere in your `PATH`, and ensure it is executable!

## ðŸŒ± Quick Start

After installing, you can follow these steps to quickly see how it works:

```bash
# Initialize an empty dotfiles repo
dot init

# Or clone your dotfiles
dot init git@github.com:alexis-moins/dotfiles.git

# Make changes to your dotfiles
touch ~/dotfiles/.bashrc

# Create symlinks to your dotfiles in $HOME
dot install

# Show changed files
dot status

# Show git diff
dot diff

# Stage one or more files
dot stage

# Save your changes...
dot commit "feat: add .bashrc"

# ...and push them to your remote!
dot sync
```
